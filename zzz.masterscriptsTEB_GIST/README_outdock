mol# id_num flexiblecode matched nscored time hac setnum matnum rank cloud elect + gist + vdW + psol + asol + inter + rec_e + rec_d + r_hyd = Total


mol# is just the number of the molecule, read in from the docking db2 files.
id_num is the ZINC code or other identifier for the molecule
flexiblecode is the combination of flexible receptor parts this molecule was docked to
matched is the number of matched orientations actually found by the matching algorithm
nscored is the number of atoms that were scored
time is the time in seconds for this molecule
hac is the heavy atom count for this ligand
setnum is the conformation number this ligand represents
matnum is the match number this ligand represents
rank is the rank of the score for this ligand within the ligand (if you want the top 10 poses, this number will increase from 1 to 10)
cloud is the cloud number, for an experimental matching scheme still under development
electrostatics is the electrostatics score
vdW is the van der Waals score (both attractive and repulsive together)
psol is the ligand polar desolvation
asol is the ligand apolar desolvation
inter is the internal energy
rec_e is the receptor energy (used in flexible docking)
rec_d is the receptor desolvation, not yet supported
r_hyd is the receptor hydrophobic effect, not yet supported
Total is the total score for this ligand pose
