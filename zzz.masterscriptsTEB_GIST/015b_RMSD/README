# get the corespondance between docking names of molcules and the pdb names (003-004).  we do this with smiles, fp, and Tc calculations. 
#  -- this needs chemaxon to work.  
#  --
#  -- you can also do the corespondance by hand.  
 
# calculate the rmsd using DOCK6.6 (006)  

# process the rmsd to get stats (007).
